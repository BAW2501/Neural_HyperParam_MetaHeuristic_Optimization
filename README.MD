# NeuralNetHyperOpt 

This repository contains Python code for optimizing the hyperparameters of neural networks using metaheuristic search algorithms.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to automate neural network hyperparameter tuning using genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, ant colony optimization, and other metaheuristic techniques. This aims to find optimal hyperparameters that maximize accuracy/performance while minimizing computational resources required for training deep learning models.


## Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- scikit-learn
- mealpy
